1
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:00,462
Good morning...

2
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:05,984
I'm Dr. Jung.

3
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:08,487
I admitted you yesterday.

4
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:12,683
I'm not...

5
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:16,145
I'm not mad, you know.

6
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:21,775
Let me explain what I have in mind.

7
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:28,198
I propose that we meet here, most
days, to talk for an hour or two.

8
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,117
Talk?

9
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:31,535
Yes.

10
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:32,703
Just talk.

11
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,040
See if we can identify
what's troubling you.

12
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:41,962
So as to distract you as little as possible,
I'm going to sit there, behind you.

13
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm going to ask you to try not to turn around
and look at me under any circumstances.

14
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:51,847
Now...

15
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:09,323
Have you any idea what may have brought
on these attacks you suffer from?

16
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:11,533
Hu...

17
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:17,498
humiliation.

18
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,629
Any kind of...

19
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,758
humiliation.

20
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,805
Like, I can't bear to see it and
it makes me feel nauseated.

21
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:37,601
I start pouring with sweat, cold sweat.

22
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:39,810
My...

23
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:40,396
my...

24
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:51,907
my father lost his temper all the time.
He was always angry with me.

25
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:02,042
When you stopped talking just now,
did a thought come into your head?

26
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,045
I...

27
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:06,380
I don't know...

28
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:08,590
Or an image, perhaps.

29
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:10,551
Was it an image?

30
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:11,844
Yes.

31
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:14,513
What was the image?

32
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,851
It was a hand.

33
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,435
My...

34
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:19,935
my...

35
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:23,522
my father's hand.

36
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,315
Why do you think you saw that?

37
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,529
Whenever he would...

38
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:34,199
after...

39
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,034
whenever he...

40
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,832
he hit us, afterward we...

41
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:45,377
we had to kiss his hand.

42
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:55,179
What's odd is that case I was writing up last
week, I happened to pick the codename Sabina S.

43
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,431
And here she is... Sabina Spielrein.

44
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,225
Quite a coincidence.

45
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:03,645
As you know, I don't believe
there is such a thing.

46
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,275
Spielrein's not a very Russian name.

47
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,694
No, Jewish.

48
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:14,448
Father's a very successful
import-export man.

49
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,410
And she's exceptionally well
educated, speaks fluent German.

50
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,288
Aspires to be a doctor herself, apparently.

51
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:23,332
Perhaps she's the one.

52
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,542
What one?

53
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:27,293
The one you've been looking for.

54
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,338
For your experimental treatment.

55
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,673
The talking cure.

56
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,385
You're so astute.

57
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:37,304
I've already begun it with her.

58
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:40,057
He's kicking.

59
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,600
Can you feel?

60
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:45,187
Oh, yes.

61
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,563
There he is.

62
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:52,768
What I don't understand is
why Freud, having proposed

63
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,327
this radical therapeutic idea,
this talking cure, this

64
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:59,757
psychoanalysis, then lets
years go by without giving

65
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:03,122
even the barest outline of
his clinical procedures?

66
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,456
What's he playing at?

67
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,167
Presumably he uses the
method on his patients?

68
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,919
I've no idea.

69
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,464
So might you be the first
doctor to try this out?

70
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,549
It's possible.

71
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,176
Why don't you write and ask him?

72
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,012
I don't know him.

73
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:24,852
As it happens, Miss Spielrein's mother
wanted to take her to see Freud.

74
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,564
Another coincidence.

75
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,694
My father thinks my
mother doesn't love him.

76
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,155
And he's right, she doesn't.

77
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:37,990
How do you know?

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,660
My angel told me.

79
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:44,079
What angel?

80
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,458
An inner voice.

81
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:50,961
He used to tell me I was
an exceptional person.

82
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:53,422
For some reason he always spoke in German.

83
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:57,176
Angels always speak German
... It's traditional.

84
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:01,930
He gave me the power to know what people are
going to say before they open their mouths.

85
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,808
Useful ability for a doctor.

86
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,020
You hope to be a doctor
some day, don't you?

87
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,190
I'll never be a doctor.

88
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,483
Why not?

89
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,120
I have to go away for awhile.

90
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:26,997
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,040
We've just gotten started.

92
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,292
Military service.

93
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,751
We all have to do it.

94
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,504
Just for a couple of weeks.

95
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:34,213
It's a waste of time!

96
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,758
I can't tell you whatever
it is you want to know!

97
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,509
You're just...

98
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,510
you're just making me angry.

99
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,428
And even if I could tell you,
you'd be sorry you ever...!

100
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,183
Anyway, there's nothing wrong with me!

101
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,393
I don't even want to get better!

102
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:51,563
Stop it!

103
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:53,565
What?

104
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,776
Will you just stop that!

105
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,863
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,577
Can we get back now?

107
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,037
Yes, if you want to.

108
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,122
I need to get back.

109
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,376
It's a complete waste of my time.

110
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:20,092
Writing prescriptions for athlete's foot and
examining cocks from morning 'til night.

111
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:22,553
Is that what you do?

112
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:24,722
It's not good for me.

113
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:26,724
It's not good for my patients.

114
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,078
You're playing with your food.

115
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,955
I'm not hungry.

116
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,416
Is that so?

117
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:58,297
I shall have to tell Professor Bleuler.

118
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,673
Ha.

119
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,676
Do what you like.

120
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:25,365
Please, Miss, give me your hand.

121
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:26,241
Please.

122
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:29,078
You'll catch your death.

123
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,662
Miss Spielrein.

124
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,043
The Herr Direktor.

125
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:40,631
I feel you may have a little
too much time on your hands.

126
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:44,510
I'm a great believer in getting our
patients involved in some productive work.

127
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,553
What are your particular interests?

128
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:49,515
Suicide.

129
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,059
Interplanetary travel.

130
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:54,269
When Dr.

131
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:57,898
Jung returns, I shall ask him to discuss
all this with you in more detail.

132
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,276
You keep him away from me.

133
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:02,320
I never want to see him again!

134
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:13,456
Now, come along.

135
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:14,665
Don't make such a fuss.

136
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:17,960
Give me those legs.

137
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:27,845
Here's the sponge?

138
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:29,514
Just lie still.

139
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:31,891
That's better.

140
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:37,355
Hello?

141
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:40,983
I'm back.

142
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,069
How have you been?

143
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:49,909
I've been talking to the Herr Direktor
about finding some work for you.

144
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:53,162
I told him you'd always been
interested in medicine.

145
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:57,542
So he suggested you might like to
assist me occasionally in my research.

146
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:05,466
We're quite short-staffed so it
would certainly be a help to me.

147
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:04,192
Vienna.

148
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:05,818
Woods.

149
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:08,153
Box.

150
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:09,613
Bed.

151
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:11,949
Money.

152
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:13,242
Bank.

153
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:17,538
Child.

154
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,248
Soon.

155
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:22,335
Family.

156
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:28,841
Unit.

157
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:31,511
Sex.

158
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:32,637
Uh...

159
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:35,431
male.

160
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,016
Wall.

161
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:38,851
Flower.

162
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:43,689
Young.

163
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:49,445
Baby.

164
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:52,532
Ask.

165
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:53,950
Answer.

166
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,117
Cap.

167
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:55,993
Wear.

168
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:56,953
Stubborn.

169
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,704
Give way.

170
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:04,460
Ruefulness.

171
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:11,884
Child.

172
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,181
Fame.

173
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:18,266
Doctor.

174
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:24,188
Divorce.

175
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,444
No.

176
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,699
Thank you.

177
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:39,787
Is that all?

178
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:40,997
That's all.

179
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:43,749
How did I do?

180
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,042
Beautifully.

181
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:53,634
Good bye.

182
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:56,262
Yes, good bye.

183
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:08,733
Any preliminary observations?

184
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,448
Obviously, what's uppermost
in her mind is her pregnancy.

185
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:18,618
Good.

186
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:21,787
And she's a little...

187
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:24,665
what's the word?

188
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:30,755
Why don't we try a useful word invented
by our Herr Direktor: Ambivalent.

189
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:35,718
Yes, about the baby.

190
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,761
Anything else?

191
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:42,099
I'd say she was worried her husband
might be losing interest in her.

192
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:47,104
What makes you think that?

193
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:51,901
Long reaction times to the
words "family" and "divorce".

194
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:53,861
I see.

195
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:56,906
And when you said "cap", she said "wear".

196
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:59,575
Might that be a reference to contraception?

197
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:03,579
You have quite a flair for this.

198
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,874
Can I ask you something?

199
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,709
Of course.

200
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,129
Is she your wife?

201
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:25,893
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,230
Sorry?

203
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:33,317
I promised you a son on Christmas Day.

204
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,778
And here she is a day
late and the wrong sex.

205
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:44,453
Don't be absurd.

206
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:00,761
'A' for Agathe.

207
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:05,099
Next time I'll give you a boy.

208
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:10,188
Can you explain why your
nights have been so bad?

209
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:17,778
I'm afraid.

210
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,821
Of what?

211
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:24,202
There's something in the room.

212
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:24,952
Something like...

213
00:16:27,246 --> 00:16:29,539
like a cat, only it can speak.

214
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,666
It gets into bed with me.

215
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,671
Last...

216
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,845
last night, it suddenly
whispered something in my ear.

217
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:43,804
I couldn't hear what.

218
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:47,266
But then...

219
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:03,616
I felt it against my back.

220
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:09,205
Something slimy like...

221
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:19,966
like some kind of a mollusk,
moving against my back.

222
00:17:23,928 --> 00:17:24,720
But when I...

223
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:28,099
when I turned around,
there was nothing there.

224
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:33,187
You felt it against your back?

225
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:35,731
Yes.

226
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:37,900
Were you naked?

227
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:41,904
I was.

228
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:44,323
Were you masturbating?

229
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:49,620
Yes.

230
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,752
Tell me about the first time you can
remember being beaten by your father.

231
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,135
I suppose I was about four.

232
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:10,516
I'd broken a plate or...

233
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,978
oh, yes, and...

234
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:24,405
and he told me to go into the little
room and take my clothes off.

235
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:24,989
And then...

236
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:36,834
he came in... and spanked me.

237
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:37,460
And then...

238
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:45,343
I was so frightened that I
wet myself and then he...

239
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,804
he hit me again.

240
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:52,391
And then I...

241
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:58,981
That first time, how did you
feel about what was happening?

242
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:07,031
<whispering> I liked it.

243
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,867
Would you repeat that, please?

244
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:11,244
I couldn't quite hear.

245
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:15,665
I liked it.

246
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,462
It excited me.

247
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:26,634
And did you continue to like it?

248
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,347
<crying> Yes!

249
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,851
Yes!

250
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:44,068
Before long, he only just had to say to me
to go to the little room and I would...

251
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:48,406
I would start to get wet.

252
00:19:54,328 --> 00:20:01,627
When it came to my brothers or
even just threatened that...

253
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:04,630
that was enough.

254
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:05,715
I'd have to go down and...

255
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:09,594
I wanted to lie down and touch myself.

256
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:13,723
Later, at school, anything would...

257
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:19,562
set it off, any kind of humiliation.

258
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:22,607
I looked for any humiliation.

259
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:28,946
Even here when you hit
my coat with your stick.

260
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:33,743
I had to come back right
away, I was so excited.

261
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,294
There's...

262
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:47,924
there's no hope for me.

263
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:52,634
I'm vile and filthy and corrupt.

264
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,894
I must...

265
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,940
I must never be let out of here.

266
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,071
So good to meet you at long last.

267
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:51,946
Professor Freud.

268
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:55,200
You're most welcome.

269
00:21:56,826 --> 00:21:57,535
Please.

270
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,419
Perhaps the terms themselves
should be reviewed.

271
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:10,308
If, for instance, we could come
up with some milder term than

272
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:13,968
"libido" we might not encounter
such emotional resistance.

273
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,971
It would make the teaching
side of things much easier.

274
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:19,140
Is euphemism a good idea?

275
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:23,395
Once they work out what we actually mean,
they'll be just as appalled as ever.

276
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:27,524
I take your point, but I still
think it's worth trying to

277
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:30,485
sweeten the pill when it comes
to questions of sexuality.

278
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:34,614
And, by the way, please don't feel
you have to restrain yourself here.

279
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:39,411
My family are all veterans of the most
unsuitable topics of mealtime conversation.

280
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,538
I have a number of clinical
examples which I believe

281
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,096
support my position with
regard to sexuality.

282
00:22:58,138 --> 00:22:59,389
Hm.

283
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:05,979
And how is your little Russian patient?

284
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:12,861
As I told you, after the initial abreaction
there was the most dramatic improvement.

285
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:15,400
We've enrolled her in the
medical school at the

286
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:17,741
University where she's
doing extremely well.

287
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:21,703
She's a walking advertisement for the
effectiveness of psychoanalysis.

288
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:24,247
Psychoanalysis.

289
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:26,875
Oh?

290
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,627
It's more logical.

291
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:33,590
And it sounds better.

292
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:35,967
If you say so.

293
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:43,016
Are you still treating her?

294
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:48,521
Yes, and we continue to
unearth new material.

295
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:55,667
For example, the extraordinary procedure she
devised as a small child, where she would sit on

296
00:23:55,668 --> 00:24:01,575
one heel, attempt to defecate and at the same
time try to prevent herself from defecating.

297
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:02,702
Hm.

298
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:07,665
She said this gave rise to
the most blissful feelings.

299
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,876
Nice story.

300
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:14,072
Those of my patients who remain
fixated at the anal stage of their

301
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:17,050
erotic development often come out
with the most amusing details.

302
00:24:17,926 --> 00:24:21,106
And, of course, all of them
are finicky, compulsively

303
00:24:21,107 --> 00:24:23,932
tidy, stubborn and extremely
stingy with money.

304
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:26,476
No doubt your Russian
conforms to this pattern.

305
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:29,229
Well, no, she doesn't.

306
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:34,869
The masochistic aspects of
her condition are much more

307
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,488
deeply rooted than any anal
fixations we may have uncovered.

308
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,448
The two are intimately connected.

309
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,954
I can only tell you that
she's rather disorganized,

310
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:49,332
emotionally generous and
exceptionally idealistic.

311
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:52,377
Well, perhaps it's a Russian thing.

312
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,506
Is she a virgin?

313
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:59,591
Yes.

314
00:24:59,592 --> 00:25:00,427
Certainly.

315
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:01,928
Mmm.

316
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,638
Almost certainly.

317
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,350
No, certainly.

318
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:11,771
Hm.

319
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,155
I don't think you have
any notion of the true

320
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:30,457
strengths and depths of the
opposition to our work.

321
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:36,254
There's a whole medical establishment, of
course, baying to send Freud to the auto-da-fe.

322
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:39,547
But that's as nothing compared to
what happens when our ideas begin to

323
00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:42,844
trickle through in whatever garbled
form they're relayed to the public.

324
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:47,265
The denials, the frenzy,
the incoherent rage.

325
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:51,665
But might that not be caused
by your insistence on the

326
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:55,190
exclusively sexual interpretation
of the clinical material?

327
00:25:57,067 --> 00:26:01,321
All I'm doing is pointing out what experience
indicates to me must be the truth.

328
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:05,533
And I can assure you that in a hundred year's
time, our work will still be rejected.

329
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:10,538
Columbus, you know, had no idea
what country he'd discovered.

330
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,208
Like him, I'm in the dark.

331
00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:18,004
All I know is I've set foot on the
shore and the country exists.

332
00:26:19,673 --> 00:26:21,466
I think of you more as Galileo.

333
00:26:22,634 --> 00:26:25,083
And your opponents as those
who condemned him, while

334
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,347
refusing even to put their
eye to his telescope.

335
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:32,060
In any event, I have simply opened a door.

336
00:26:32,102 --> 00:26:35,522
It's for the young men like
yourself to walk through it.

337
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:38,483
I'm sure you have many
more doors to open for us.

338
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:45,989
Of course, there's the added difficulty,
more ammunition for our enemies,

339
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:51,830
that all of us here in Vienna, in our
psychoanalytical circle, are Jews.

340
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:55,709
I don't see what difference that makes.

341
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:04,509
That, if I may say so, is an
exquisitely Protestant remark.

342
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:12,684
I dreamed...

343
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:20,316
I dreamed about a horse being hoisted
by cables to a considerable height.

344
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:24,696
Suddenly, a cable breaks and the
horse is dashed to the ground.

345
00:27:24,738 --> 00:27:26,406
But it's not hurt.

346
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:30,676
It leaps up and gallops away,
impeded only by a heavy

347
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:33,663
log, which it's obliged
to drag along the ground.

348
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:39,294
Then a rider on a small horse appears in front
of it so that it's forced to slow down.

349
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:42,757
And a carriage appears in
front of the small horse so

350
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:46,051
that our horse is compelled
to slow down even more.

351
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:53,099
I imagine the horse is yourself.

352
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,060
Yes.

353
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:58,271
Your ambition has been
frustrated in some way.

354
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:02,067
The rider slowing me down.

355
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:03,068
Yes.

356
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:07,364
I think this may refer to
my wife's first pregnancy.

357
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:11,201
I had to give up an opportunity
to go to America because of it.

358
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:12,369
Ah.

359
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:19,157
The carriage in front perhaps alludes to
an apprehension that our two daughters,

360
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:24,381
and other children perhaps still to come,
will impede my progress even more.

361
00:28:24,422 --> 00:28:27,592
As a father of six, I can vouch for that.

362
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:31,471
Not to mention the inevitable
financial difficulties.

363
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:32,138
No.

364
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:34,557
Fortunately, my wife is extremely wealthy.

365
00:28:36,393 --> 00:28:37,227
Ah.

366
00:28:38,812 --> 00:28:39,604
Yes.

367
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:42,023
That is fortunate.

368
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:53,243
This log...

369
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:55,328
Yes?

370
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,374
I think, perhaps, you should entertain the
possibility that it represents the penis.

371
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:03,628
Yes.

372
00:29:05,672 --> 00:29:10,114
In which case what may be at issue
is that a certain sexual constraint

373
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:14,681
has been brought about by a fear of a
succession of endless pregnancies.

374
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:20,074
I'm bound to say that if one
of my patients had brought me

375
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:23,565
this dream I might have said
that the number of restraining

376
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:27,289
elements surrounding this unfortunate
horse could perhaps point

377
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,780
to the determined suppression
of some unruly sexual desire.

378
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:34,325
Yes.

379
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:37,078
There is that as well.

380
00:29:46,463 --> 00:29:53,595
I wonder if you're aware of the fact that our
conversation has so far lasted 13 hours?

381
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:56,930
I'm so sorry.

382
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:57,807
I had no idea.

383
00:29:57,349 --> 00:29:59,643
My dear young colleague,
please don't apologize.

384
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:04,898
It was our first meeting, we had a
great deal to say to one another.

385
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:12,197
And unless I'm much
mistaken, we always will.

386
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:16,618
I shall have to be extremely careful.

387
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:18,579
What do you mean?

388
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,288
Why?

389
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:22,416
He's so persuasive, he's so convincing.

390
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:26,378
He makes you feel you should abandon your
own ideas and simply follow in his wake.

391
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:31,008
His followers in Vienna are
all deeply unimpressive.

392
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:36,221
A crowd of Bohemians and degenerates just
picking up the crumbs from his table.

393
00:30:36,263 --> 00:30:38,635
Well, perhaps he's reached
the stage where obedience

394
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,559
is more important to
him than originality.

395
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:41,518
Hm.

396
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,353
I tried to tackle him about his
obsession with sexuality, his

397
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:48,901
insistence on interpreting
every symptom in sexual terms.

398
00:30:48,942 --> 00:30:51,320
But he's completely inflexible.

399
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:55,199
In my case, of course he'd have been right.

400
00:30:56,491 --> 00:31:00,536
Yes, as you would expect
him to be in many cases.

401
00:31:00,537 --> 00:31:02,581
Possibly even the majority of cases.

402
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:07,711
But there must be more than
one hinge into the universe.

403
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:32,361
Do you like Wagner?

404
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,905
The music and the man, yes.

405
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:37,032
I'm very interested in
the myth of Siegfried.

406
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:40,368
The idea that something
pure and heroic can come...

407
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:44,540
can perhaps only come...
from a sin, even a sin as dark as incest.

408
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,709
This is very strange.

409
00:31:48,627 --> 00:31:49,419
What?

410
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:52,172
As I've told you, I don't
believe in coincidence.

411
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:54,091
I believe nothing happens by accident.

412
00:31:54,132 --> 00:31:55,843
All these things have significance.

413
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:59,680
The fact is I'm in the middle of writing
something myself about the Siegfried myth.

414
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:00,428
Are you really?

415
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:01,098
I assure you.

416
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:04,226
Which is your favourite of the operas?

417
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:05,727
Das Rheingold.

418
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:07,855
Yes, that's right.

419
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:09,147
Mine too.

420
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:12,985
Can I ask you something?

421
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:14,361
Of course.

422
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:21,118
Do you think there's any possibility
I could ever be a psychiatrist?

423
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:23,954
I know you could.

424
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,791
I hear nothing but good reports
on your work at the university.

425
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:31,086
You're exactly the kind of person we need.

426
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:33,964
Insane, you mean?

427
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:37,509
<laughing> Yes.

428
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:40,637
We sane doctors have serious limitations.

429
00:32:42,347 --> 00:32:46,845
"Dear Friend, I feel I can, at
last, permit myself this informal

430
00:32:46,846 --> 00:32:51,481
mode of address as I ask you to
grant me a very particular favour.

431
00:32:51,523 --> 00:32:55,105
Dr. Otto Gross, a most
brilliant but erratic

432
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:59,323
character, is urgently in
need of your medical help.

433
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:03,357
I consider him, apart from
yourself, the only man

434
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,705
capable of making a major
contribution to our field.

435
00:33:07,331 --> 00:33:10,225
Whatever you do, don't let
him out before October

436
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:13,003
when I shall be able to
take him over from you.

437
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:17,288
And remember his father's
warning, made when Otto was

438
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:22,221
only a very small child.
'Watch out for him, he bites.'"

439
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:25,057
You still feel threatened by your father?

440
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:31,688
Anyone with any sense feels
threatened by my father.

441
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:34,650
He is extremely threatening.

442
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,330
His wish to have you
hospitalized, you don't think

443
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:45,869
that arises from a concern
for your welfare?

444
00:33:49,039 --> 00:34:02,010
Listen, what does any normal old patriarch
want in the twilight of his life?

445
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:08,517
Grandchildren, grandsons, am I right?

446
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:13,838
And yet, last summer, when I presented him
with not one, but two little Grosses,

447
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,442
one by my wife, one by one of my most
respectable mistresses, was he grateful?

448
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:43,158
And now that there's another
one on the way, admittedly

449
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,638
by some woman I hardly
know, he's apoplectic.

450
00:34:48,307 --> 00:34:51,226
And all he can think is to get me
banged away in some institution.

451
00:34:55,355 --> 00:34:56,815
You got any children?

452
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:58,734
Two girls.

453
00:34:58,775 --> 00:34:59,610
Same mother?

454
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:00,694
Yes.

455
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:07,743
So you're not a believer in monogamy?

456
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,624
For a neurotic like myself, I can't
possibly imagine a more stressful concept.

457
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:21,910
And you don't find it necessary or
desirable to exercise some restraint

458
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:26,554
as a contribution, say, to the
smooth functioning of civilization.

459
00:35:26,595 --> 00:35:29,098
What, and make myself ill?

460
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:33,595
I should have thought that
some form of sexual repression

461
00:35:33,596 --> 00:35:36,355
would have to be practiced
in any rational society.

462
00:35:38,899 --> 00:35:41,569
No wonder the hospitals
are bulging at the seams.

463
00:35:46,032 --> 00:35:50,171
Tell me, do you find the best way
to enhance your popularity with

464
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:54,498
your patients is to tell them whatever
it is they most want to hear?

465
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:58,085
What does it matter whether
we're popular with them or not?

466
00:35:58,127 --> 00:35:59,211
Well, I don't know.

467
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:01,964
Suppose you want to fuck them?

468
00:36:07,803 --> 00:36:16,228
If there is one thing I've learned in my short
never repress anything.

469
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:05,569
So you've never slept with
any of your patients?

470
00:37:06,904 --> 00:37:07,697
Of course not.

471
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:12,440
I have to steer through the
temptations of transference and

472
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:16,247
counter-transference and that's an
essential stage of the process.

473
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:23,373
When transference occurs, when the
patient becomes fixated on me, I explain

474
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:29,134
to her that this is merely a symbol
of her wretched monogamous habits.

475
00:37:29,135 --> 00:37:34,484
I assure her that it's fine to want to sleep
with me, but only if, at the same time,

476
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:39,770
she acknowledges to herself that she wants
to sleep with a great many other people.

477
00:37:40,813 --> 00:37:41,939
Suppose she doesn't?

478
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:45,860
Then it's my job to convince her
that's part of the illness.

479
00:37:50,614 --> 00:37:51,991
That's what people are like.

480
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:55,161
If we don't tell them the truth, who will?

481
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:58,581
You think Freud's right?

482
00:37:58,622 --> 00:38:02,460
You think all neurosis is of
exclusively sexual origin?

483
00:38:05,713 --> 00:38:08,894
I think Freud's obsession
with sex probably has a great

484
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:11,677
deal to do with the fact
that he never gets any.

485
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:14,472
You could be right.

486
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:22,698
It seems to me a measure of the true perversity
of the human race, that one of its very few

487
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:29,195
reliably pleasurable activities should be the
subject of so much hysteria and repression.

488
00:38:32,114 --> 00:38:38,079
But not to repress yourself is to unleash all
kinds of dangerous and destructive forces.

489
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,626
Our job is to make our
patients capable of freedom.

490
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:50,174
I've heard it said that you helped one
of your patients to kill herself.

491
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:53,177
She was resolutely suicidal.

492
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:57,181
I just explained how she could
do it without botching it.

493
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:02,770
Then I asked her if she didn't prefer
the idea of becoming my lover.

494
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:08,901
She opted for both.

495
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:12,446
That can't be what we
want for our patients.

496
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,328
Freedom is freedom.

497
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:24,542
I've been thinking about Wagner's opera.

498
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:28,277
In it, he says that perfection
can only be arrived at through

499
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:31,674
what is conventionally thought
of as sin, is that right?

500
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:37,930
Which must surely have to do with the energy
created by the friction of opposites.

501
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:43,436
Not just that you're the doctor and I'm the
patient, but that you're Swiss and I'm Russian.

502
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:47,690
I'm Jewish and you're Aryan and all
other kinds of darker differences.

503
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:49,734
Darker?

504
00:39:49,775 --> 00:39:57,158
If I'm right, only the clash of destructive
forces can create something new.

505
00:39:58,785 --> 00:40:03,873
When my father brought me to you, I was
very ill and my illness was sexual.

506
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:08,503
It's clear that the subject I'm studying
is entirely grounded in sexuality.

507
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:11,284
So, naturally, I'm becoming
more and more acutely

508
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:14,133
aware of the fact that I
have no sexual experience.

509
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,596
Law students are not normally
expected to rob banks.

510
00:40:34,404 --> 00:40:37,031
It's generally thought to be the man
who should take the initiative.

511
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:41,244
Don't you think there's
something male in every woman?

512
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:43,538
And something female in every man?

513
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,998
Or should be?

514
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:46,708
Maybe.

515
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:50,753
I expect you're right, yes.

516
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:57,032
If you ever want to take
the initiative, I live

517
00:40:57,033 --> 00:41:01,014
in that building there,
where the bay window is.

518
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:19,240
I can't understand what you're waiting for.

519
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:25,787
Just take her to some secluded spot and
thrash her to within an inch of her life.

520
00:41:25,788 --> 00:41:27,707
That's clearly what she wants.

521
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,419
How can you deny her
such a simple pleasure?

522
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,464
Pleasure is never simple,
as you very well know.

523
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:37,675
It is.

524
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:39,719
Of course it is.

525
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,597
Until we decide to complicate it.

526
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:46,100
What my father calls maturity.

527
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:48,895
What I call surrender.

528
00:41:51,314 --> 00:41:53,525
Surrender, for me, would be
to give in to these urges.

529
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:55,026
Then surrender.

530
00:41:56,986 --> 00:42:00,657
It doesn't matter what you call it as long
as you don't let the experience escape.

531
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:05,286
That's my prescription.

532
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:08,748
I'm supposed to be treating you.

533
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,709
And it's been most effective.

534
00:42:12,293 --> 00:42:19,008
<laughing> I'd say the analysis
was not too far from completion.

535
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:22,720
Mine, yes.

536
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:26,057
Not so sure about yours.

537
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:31,242
I've been spending so much
time with him, I'm afraid

538
00:42:31,243 --> 00:42:33,898
I've been neglecting some
of my other patients.

539
00:42:36,442 --> 00:42:42,073
He's immensely seductive, quite sure
he's right and obsessionally neurotic.

540
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:45,535
Pretty dangerous, in fact.

541
00:42:48,872 --> 00:42:51,165
Do you mean you doubt your
powers to convince him?

542
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,459
Worse than that.

543
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:57,380
What I'm afraid of is his
power to convince me.

544
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:02,852
On the subject of monogamy, for
example, why should we put so much

545
00:43:02,853 --> 00:43:06,723
frantic effort into suppressing
our most basic natural instincts?

546
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:10,226
I don't know.

547
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:11,311
You tell me.

548
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:24,699
Thank you.

549
00:43:26,576 --> 00:43:27,827
I really needed that.

550
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:12,747
<i>Dr. Jung, rest assured that thanks
to you, I am alive and healthy.</i>

551
00:44:13,748 --> 00:44:17,585
<i>But please be so good as to
tell my father that I am dead.</i>

552
00:44:19,254 --> 00:44:24,092
<i>And whatever you do, do not pass by
the oasis without stopping to drink.</i>

553
00:44:25,218 --> 00:44:26,010
<i>Otto.</i>

554
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,159
Who is it?

555
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:52,996
A friend.

556
00:45:01,254 --> 00:45:02,088
Come inside.

557
00:45:56,476 --> 00:45:57,393
It's so beautiful.

558
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,772
I feel as though we've always lived here.

559
00:46:00,813 --> 00:46:03,816
They say we'll be able to move
in by the end of the week.

560
00:46:06,736 --> 00:46:08,488
I'm sorry to be like this again.

561
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:10,240
What do you mean?

562
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:13,576
So big and unattractive.

563
00:46:13,618 --> 00:46:15,119
Don't be absurd.

564
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,124
I expect you wish you were a
polygamist, like Otto Gross.

565
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:30,385
If I were, it would be something quite
different than what we have, which is sacred.

566
00:46:32,387 --> 00:46:34,013
I would have to be sure
you understood that.

567
00:46:36,474 --> 00:46:38,393
I wouldn't want to know anything about it.

568
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,730
I have a surprise for you.

569
00:46:52,115 --> 00:46:55,577
The boat you always wanted with red sails.

570
00:46:58,913 --> 00:46:59,789
Thank you.

571
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:04,210
Thank you for all of this.

572
00:47:05,295 --> 00:47:06,546
You're a good man.

573
00:47:08,256 --> 00:47:10,425
You deserve everything that's good.

574
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:29,277
If I say something, will you promise
not to take it the wrong way?

575
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:32,572
What?

576
00:47:36,826 --> 00:47:38,453
Don't you think we ought to stop...

577
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:40,580
now?

578
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:44,918
I'm married.

579
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:47,962
Obviously, I'm being deceitful.

580
00:47:50,131 --> 00:47:52,592
Is it right for us to
perpetuate this deceit?

581
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:54,427
Do you want to stop?

582
00:47:55,637 --> 00:47:56,804
Of course I don't.

583
00:48:02,602 --> 00:48:08,191
When you make love to your wife, how is it?

584
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:11,110
Describe it to me.

585
00:48:15,782 --> 00:48:19,911
When you live under the same roof
with someone, it becomes habit.

586
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:24,624
You know, it's always very tender.

587
00:48:26,835 --> 00:48:28,503
Then this is another thing.

588
00:48:30,046 --> 00:48:33,633
Another thing in another country.

589
00:48:39,806 --> 00:48:43,935
With me, I want you to be ferocious.

590
00:48:46,688 --> 00:48:48,314
I want you to punish me.

591
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,376
I knew it was a boy this time.

592
00:49:08,418 --> 00:49:10,253
I told you.

593
00:49:10,962 --> 00:49:12,130
I believed you.

594
00:49:17,218 --> 00:49:18,845
Will you come back to us now?

595
00:50:22,993 --> 00:50:23,702
Pity.

596
00:50:23,744 --> 00:50:26,955
I should never have sent
Doctor Gross to you.

597
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:28,915
I blame myself.

598
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:31,251
No, I'm very grateful you did.

599
00:50:31,293 --> 00:50:35,130
All those provocative discussions helped
crystallize a lot of my thinking.

600
00:50:35,172 --> 00:50:36,757
Hm.

601
00:50:37,632 --> 00:50:40,427
Did he really send you his hotel bill?

602
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:43,096
Only for a couple of nights.

603
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:47,934
He's an addict.

604
00:50:48,685 --> 00:50:49,853
I can see that now.

605
00:50:50,604 --> 00:50:53,732
He can only end by doing
great harm to our movement.

606
00:50:57,486 --> 00:51:01,615
You realize this makes you
undisputed Crown Prince, don't you?

607
00:51:02,616 --> 00:51:03,825
My son and heir?

608
00:51:05,243 --> 00:51:07,871
I'm not sure I deserve such an accolade.

609
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:09,998
Don't say another word.

610
00:51:13,543 --> 00:51:15,629
I often take my walk up here.

611
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:20,175
It's inspired some of my best ideas.

612
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:23,804
You mustn't think I have a closed mind.

613
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:27,334
I have absolutely no
objection to your studying

614
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:31,186
telepathy or parapsychology
to your heart's content.

615
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:37,016
But I would make the point that our
own field is so embattled that

616
00:51:37,017 --> 00:51:40,404
it can only be dangerous to stray
into any kind of mysticism.

617
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:42,406
Don't you see?

618
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:45,826
We have to stay within the most
rigorously scientific confines.

619
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,039
Are you all right?

620
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:54,083
Yes, but I can't agree with you.

621
00:51:54,084 --> 00:52:00,132
Why should we draw some arbitrary line and
rule out whole areas of investigation?

622
00:52:00,173 --> 00:52:02,724
Precisely because the
world is full of enemies

623
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:05,220
looking for any way they
can to discredit us.

624
00:52:05,262 --> 00:52:09,527
And the moment they see us abandon
the firm ground of sexual theory

625
00:52:09,528 --> 00:52:13,353
to wallow in the black mud of
superstition they will pounce.

626
00:52:18,984 --> 00:52:23,238
As far as I'm concerned, even to raise
these subjects is professional suicide.

627
00:52:26,908 --> 00:52:28,493
I knew that was going to happen!

628
00:52:28,535 --> 00:52:29,619
What?

629
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:32,122
I felt something like
that was going to happen.

630
00:52:32,164 --> 00:52:33,999
I had a kind of burning in my stomach.

631
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,500
What are you talking about?

632
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:37,586
It's the heating.

633
00:52:37,627 --> 00:52:40,255
The wood in the bookcase
just cracked, that's all.

634
00:52:40,297 --> 00:52:40,797
No.

635
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:43,800
It's what's known as a catalytic
exteriorization phenomenon.

636
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:45,093
A what?

637
00:52:45,135 --> 00:52:48,180
A catalytic exteriorization phenomenon.

638
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:49,639
Don't be ridiculous.

639
00:52:49,681 --> 00:52:51,558
My diaphragm started to glow red hot.

640
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:56,563
And another thing... it's
going to happen again.

641
00:52:56,605 --> 00:52:57,314
What?

642
00:52:57,356 --> 00:52:59,316
In a minute, it's going to happen again.

643
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:03,362
My dear young friend, this is exactly
the kind of thing I'm talking about.

644
00:53:05,155 --> 00:53:05,989
You see?

645
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,116
That's just...

646
00:53:08,158 --> 00:53:10,077
you really can't be serious.

647
00:53:10,118 --> 00:53:14,122
There are so many mysteries,
so much further to go.

648
00:53:14,164 --> 00:53:14,748
Please.

649
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,832
We can't be too careful.

650
00:53:15,874 --> 00:53:19,169
We can't afford to wander
into these speculative areas.

651
00:53:19,211 --> 00:53:23,757
Telepathy, singing bookcases, fairies
at the bottom of the garden.

652
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:25,509
It won't do.

653
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:31,264
It won't do.

654
00:53:55,288 --> 00:54:00,971
There's a poem by Lermontov keeps going
round my head about a prisoner who finally

655
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:06,174
achieves some happiness when he succeeds
in releasing a bird from its cage.

656
00:54:07,175 --> 00:54:09,261
Why do you think this is preoccupying you?

657
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:15,914
I think it means that when I
become a doctor what I want

658
00:54:15,915 --> 00:54:20,772
more than anything is to give
people back their freedom...

659
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:24,317
the way you gave me mine.

660
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:27,111
Right.

661
00:54:27,112 --> 00:54:28,488
That's enough now.

662
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:33,869
There we go.

663
00:54:36,747 --> 00:54:37,789
Fascinating.

664
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:39,750
Come along, my dear.

665
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:45,630
All the standard symptoms
of the nymphomaniac.

666
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:50,886
Yes.

667
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:56,892
Except that whenever anyone responded
to her advances, she would run a mile.

668
00:54:58,185 --> 00:55:00,020
That's the puzzling feature of the case.

669
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:03,815
Hm.

670
00:55:05,692 --> 00:55:09,696
I must say it's a great pleasure to
see you in your natural habitat.

671
00:55:26,046 --> 00:55:28,177
There's a rumour running
around Vienna that

672
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:30,550
you've taken one of your
patients as a mistress.

673
00:55:33,845 --> 00:55:35,305
It's absolutely untrue.

674
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:37,849
Well, of course it is.

675
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:40,686
So I've been telling everyone.

676
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:42,771
What's being said?

677
00:55:42,813 --> 00:55:45,065
Oh, I don't know.

678
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:47,943
That the woman's been bragging about it.

679
00:55:47,984 --> 00:55:51,279
That somebody is sending
out anonymous letters.

680
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:52,531
The usual sort of thing.

681
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:56,535
Bound to happen sooner or later.

682
00:55:57,994 --> 00:55:59,788
It's an occupational hazard.

683
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:04,209
Yes.

684
00:56:05,794 --> 00:56:09,339
I hope I'd never be stupid enough to get
emotionally involved with a patient.

685
00:56:13,635 --> 00:56:14,553
I'm confused.

686
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:15,929
I feel trapped.

687
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:20,017
I've trapped myself into
feeling divided, guilty.

688
00:56:20,058 --> 00:56:22,060
I've never wanted you to feel guilty.

689
00:56:22,102 --> 00:56:23,729
I don't see how we can go on.

690
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:27,566
You mustn't say that.

691
00:56:27,607 --> 00:56:28,692
I have some kind of illness.

692
00:56:28,734 --> 00:56:32,612
Try to remember the love and patience I
showed towards you when you were ill.

693
00:56:32,654 --> 00:56:33,613
That's what I need from you now.

694
00:56:33,655 --> 00:56:34,281
Of course.

695
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:35,782
You have it always.

696
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:38,075
Oh, please don't go.

697
00:56:38,076 --> 00:56:38,827
I must.

698
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:39,995
I have to.

699
00:56:40,037 --> 00:56:40,579
No.

700
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,494
I have to.

701
00:56:41,495 --> 00:56:42,289
No!

702
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:44,708
I have to!

703
00:57:01,725 --> 00:57:03,769
I can't say I'm sorry
to say goodbye to him.

704
00:57:04,936 --> 00:57:06,813
Not the easiest house-guest we've ever had.

705
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:08,565
No.

706
00:57:09,983 --> 00:57:12,569
I don't think he ever recovered
from the first view of the house.

707
00:57:14,363 --> 00:57:18,658
Still, I suppose compared to
that tiny flat in Vienna...

708
00:57:23,872 --> 00:57:26,082
Why did he refuse to
meet the Herr Direktor?

709
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:30,420
Oh, he's always been a great one for
bearing incomprehensible grudges.

710
00:57:32,756 --> 00:57:35,509
Did he say anything to you
about anonymous letters?

711
00:57:42,307 --> 00:57:45,310
Surely you didn't think I'd let you
go without putting up a fight?

712
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:54,403
Secretary Fraulein Spielrein!

713
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:59,032
Why are you doing this?

714
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,744
Please sit down.

715
00:58:02,786 --> 00:58:04,121
And how could you treat me this way?

716
00:58:06,331 --> 00:58:07,332
Sit down.

717
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:19,261
I tried to explain the
situation to your mother.

718
00:58:19,302 --> 00:58:21,221
I don't know how you dared
say those things to her.

719
00:58:21,263 --> 00:58:24,975
She came in waving an anonymous letter
demanding to know if it was true.

720
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:29,864
I told her even if it were,
the position would not be

721
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:33,233
quite as she imagined, since
you're no longer my patient.

722
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:35,318
Of course I'm your patient.

723
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,403
Technically not.

724
00:58:36,445 --> 00:58:37,988
Not since I stopped charging you.

725
00:58:38,864 --> 00:58:40,115
That's what she said.

726
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:44,495
I told her I didn't believe
her and she told me

727
00:58:44,496 --> 00:58:47,581
you said your fee was 20
francs a consultation.

728
00:58:47,622 --> 00:58:50,716
I was trying to make the point that
I would take you back as a patient

729
00:58:50,717 --> 00:58:53,462
but that I could only undertake
to see you inside this office.

730
00:58:55,422 --> 00:59:00,218
How can you be so cold and offhand?

731
00:59:01,595 --> 00:59:05,932
I was trying to make her understand the
distinction between a patient and a friend.

732
00:59:13,357 --> 00:59:17,903
Listen... I've made a stupid mistake.

733
00:59:17,944 --> 00:59:19,363
Is that what it was?

734
00:59:19,404 --> 00:59:22,908
I broke one of the elementary
rules of my profession.

735
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:26,661
I'm your doctor and I believe
I did you some good.

736
00:59:27,662 --> 00:59:29,873
I can't forgive myself for
overstepping the mark.

737
00:59:29,915 --> 00:59:32,346
I should have known that
if I gave you what you

738
00:59:32,347 --> 00:59:34,878
wanted you wouldn't be
able to help wanting more.

739
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,796
I don't want more.

740
00:59:35,837 --> 00:59:37,339
And I never wanted more.

741
00:59:37,381 --> 00:59:38,465
I never asked for more.

742
00:59:39,257 --> 00:59:40,425
You didn't have to ask.

743
00:59:41,385 --> 00:59:44,292
And even if you're right,
which I dispute, do you

744
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:47,140
think this is a proper way
to behave towards me?

745
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:48,975
Refusing to speak to me
except in your office?

746
00:59:49,017 --> 00:59:49,976
I'm your physician.

747
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,730
From now on, that's all I can be.

748
00:59:56,233 --> 00:59:57,651
Don't you love me anymore?

749
01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:01,906
Only as your physician.

750
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,162
You think I'm going to stand for this?

751
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:09,705
What choice do you have?

752
01:00:24,345 --> 01:00:25,971
And there's your 20 francs.

753
01:00:36,732 --> 01:00:40,728
<i>Dear Professor Freud, I would be most
grateful if you would allow me to</i>

754
01:00:40,729 --> 01:00:44,615
<i>come and visit you in Vienna on a
matter of great interest to us both.</i>

755
01:00:49,495 --> 01:00:54,207
<i>Dear Friend, I have just received
this extremely strange letter.</i>

756
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,126
<i>Do you know this woman?</i>

757
01:00:56,794 --> 01:00:57,795
<i>Who is she?</i>

758
01:01:03,676 --> 01:01:08,728
<i>As you will not doubt recall, Spielrein was
the case that brought you and me together,</i>

759
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:13,435
<i>for which reason I've always regarded her
with special gratitude and affection…</i>

760
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:17,898
<i>until I understood that she was
systematically planning my seduction.</i>

761
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,735
<i>Now I have no idea what
her intentions may be.</i>

762
01:01:21,777 --> 01:01:24,154
<i>Revenge, I suspect.</i>

763
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,826
<i>I have never shown such
friendship to a patient.</i>

764
01:01:28,868 --> 01:01:32,079
<i>Nor have I ever been made to
suffer so much in return.</i>

765
01:01:33,622 --> 01:01:37,710
<i>I am hoping you will agree to act as a
kind of go-between and avert a disaster.</i>

766
01:01:40,254 --> 01:01:44,060
<i>Your famous saying is carved in
block letters on my heart…</i>

767
01:01:44,061 --> 01:01:47,678
<i>whatever you do, give up any
idea of trying to cure them.</i>

768
01:01:54,643 --> 01:02:00,524
<i>Experiences like this, however painful,
are necessary and inevitable.</i>

769
01:02:00,566 --> 01:02:03,527
<i>Without them, how can we know life?</i>

770
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,658
<i>Dear Miss Spielrein, Dr.</i>

771
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,402
<i>Jung is a good friend and
colleague of mine whom I believe</i>

772
01:02:13,403 --> 01:02:16,540
<i>to be incapable of frivolous
or shabby behavior.</i>

773
01:02:16,582 --> 01:02:23,464
<i>What I infer from your letter is that you used
to be close friends, but are no longer so.</i>

774
01:02:24,715 --> 01:02:28,182
<i>If this is the case I would
urge you to consider whether</i>

775
01:02:28,183 --> 01:02:31,709
<i>the feelings that have survived
this close friendship are</i>

776
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:34,751
<i>not best suppressed and
forgotten and without the</i>

777
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:38,521
<i>intervention and involvement of
third persons such as myself.</i>

778
01:02:47,321 --> 01:02:48,072
<Secretary> Herr Doctor.

779
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,366
Fraulein Spielrein.

780
01:03:00,584 --> 01:03:01,335
What is it?

781
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:06,215
I heard you were leaving the hospital.

782
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:08,968
As you see.

783
01:03:10,678 --> 01:03:12,972
People are saying it's because
of the scandal I caused.

784
01:03:13,013 --> 01:03:14,682
I'd been planning to leave anyway.

785
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:21,230
Well, I'm sorry if... I precipitated it.

786
01:03:23,774 --> 01:03:25,568
You've always been something of a catalyst.

787
01:03:29,697 --> 01:03:32,241
I've had a letter from Professor Freud.

788
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:36,161
Oh, yes?

789
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:39,540
The thing that shone through
was how much he loves you.

790
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:45,588
But... what was also clear is
that you denied everything.

791
01:03:45,629 --> 01:03:49,258
You let him think I was
a fantasist or a liar.

792
01:03:50,301 --> 01:03:52,052
I don't see that it's any of his business.

793
01:03:54,138 --> 01:03:55,890
I've come here to ask
you to tell the truth.

794
01:03:58,726 --> 01:03:59,393
What?

795
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:02,562
I want you to write to him
and tell him everything.

796
01:04:02,563 --> 01:04:05,733
And then I want him to write to me again to
confirm that you've told him everything.

797
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:09,737
Are you blackmailing me?

798
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:16,952
I'm asking you to tell the truth.

799
01:04:16,994 --> 01:04:19,622
Why is this so important to you?

800
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,417
I want him to take me as his patient.

801
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,135
Does it have to be him?

802
01:04:35,721 --> 01:04:36,597
It has to be him.

803
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:45,147
You don't feel the same
way about him, do you?

804
01:04:45,189 --> 01:04:50,116
I'm disappointed by his rigid pragmatism,
his insistence that nothing can possibly

805
01:04:50,117 --> 01:04:54,865
exist unless some puny or transitory
intelligence has first become aware of it.

806
01:04:56,992 --> 01:04:58,327
All the same, will you write to him?

807
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:02,039
I could have damaged you, you know?

808
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:05,292
Far worse than I did.

809
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,128
I chose not to.

810
01:05:14,802 --> 01:05:15,553
All right.

811
01:05:15,594 --> 01:05:16,637
I'll do it.

812
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,475
Thank you.

813
01:05:24,562 --> 01:05:25,855
It means everything to me.

814
01:05:37,491 --> 01:05:38,951
Are you going somewhere for the summer?

815
01:05:40,244 --> 01:05:41,829
Berlin with my parents.

816
01:05:43,581 --> 01:05:46,959
But you are going to come back
to the university to qualify?

817
01:05:48,627 --> 01:05:49,545
Of course.

818
01:05:53,674 --> 01:05:58,012
I'm going to America with Freud,
although he doesn't yet know it.

819
01:06:00,055 --> 01:06:00,848
That's nice.

820
01:06:02,266 --> 01:06:03,017
Good bye.

821
01:06:10,524 --> 01:06:14,073
<i>...in view of my friendship
for the patient and her</i>

822
01:06:14,074 --> 01:06:17,489
<i>complete trust in me, what
I did was indefensible.</i>

823
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:22,912
<i>I confess this, very unhappily,
to you, my father-figure…</i>

824
01:06:22,953 --> 01:06:24,663
Hm.

825
01:06:31,545 --> 01:06:35,132
<i>Dear Miss Spielrein, I owe you an apology.</i>

826
01:06:35,174 --> 01:06:39,518
<i>But the fact that I was wrong and
that the man is to be blamed</i>

827
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:43,724
<i>rather than the woman satisfies
my own need to revere women.</i>

828
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:47,704
<i>Please accept my admiration
for the very dignified</i>

829
01:06:47,705 --> 01:06:50,523
<i>way in which you have
resolved this conflict.</i>

830
01:06:54,693 --> 01:06:57,071
Do we have all the necessary
paperwork, Ferenczi?

831
01:06:57,112 --> 01:06:59,698
I have everything, Professor.

832
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:01,408
Hm.

833
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,452
Good.

834
01:07:03,494 --> 01:07:05,287
I've always been in two
minds about America.

835
01:07:05,329 --> 01:07:08,290
Maybe we made a foolish error.

836
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,584
Do they really want us there?

837
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:14,171
They postponed the Congress for two
months so that you could attend.

838
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:16,173
Surely that gives you some indication.

839
01:07:16,215 --> 01:07:17,091
Hm.

840
01:07:17,132 --> 01:07:18,300
Yes.

841
01:07:18,342 --> 01:07:20,344
I think it's going to be a great adventure.

842
01:07:20,386 --> 01:07:21,220
Yes.

843
01:07:23,013 --> 01:07:24,098
I hope you're right.

844
01:07:28,769 --> 01:07:29,812
I go this way.

845
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:32,606
What do you mean?

846
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,276
I left my wife to make the arrangements.

847
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:38,404
I'm afraid she's booked me
a first-class state room.

848
01:07:40,281 --> 01:07:41,073
I see.

849
01:07:58,966 --> 01:08:03,929
I was on the Swiss-Austrian border
somewhere in the mountains at dusk.

850
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:09,476
There was a long wait because
everybody's baggage was being searched.

851
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:16,692
I noticed a decrepit customs official
wearing the old royal and imperial uniform.

852
01:08:16,734 --> 01:08:21,245
And I was watching him walking up
and down with his melancholy and

853
01:08:21,246 --> 01:08:26,159
disgruntled expression, when someone
said to me, "He isn't really there."

854
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,831
"He's a ghost who still hasn't
found out how to die properly."

855
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:37,338
Is that the whole dream?

856
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:38,839
All I can remember.

857
01:08:42,927 --> 01:08:45,054
Did you say the Swiss-Austrian border?

858
01:08:45,095 --> 01:08:46,013
Yes.

859
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,891
Must have something to do with us.

860
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:51,018
You think so?

861
01:08:55,105 --> 01:09:00,110
<clears throat> Everybody's being searched.

862
01:09:00,152 --> 01:09:01,528
Hm?

863
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:06,233
Perhaps that's an indication that
the ideas which used to flow so

864
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:11,080
freely between us are now subject
to a most suspicious examination.

865
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:12,957
You mean the ideas flowing
in your direction.

866
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:17,096
And I'm afraid the old relic
shuffling about in this

867
01:09:17,097 --> 01:09:20,463
entirely useless fashion
must almost certainly be me.

868
01:09:20,464 --> 01:09:21,215
Wait a minute.

869
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:24,468
Whom you very mercifully wish
could be put out of his misery.

870
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,763
A humane death wish.

871
01:09:31,141 --> 01:09:36,355
Perhaps the fact that he was unable to die
simply indicated the immortality of his ideas.

872
01:09:36,397 --> 01:09:37,189
Oh.

873
01:09:38,482 --> 01:09:39,441
Yes.

874
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:45,990
So you agree it must have been me?

875
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:47,700
I didn't say that.

876
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:48,909
No.

877
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,453
Never mind.

878
01:09:51,495 --> 01:09:55,708
It's a most entertaining example.

879
01:09:58,419 --> 01:09:59,461
What about you?

880
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,297
Do you have a dream to report?

881
01:10:03,549 --> 01:10:06,093
I had a most elaborate dream last night.

882
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,137
Particularly rich.

883
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:12,349
Well, let's hear it.

884
01:10:15,186 --> 01:10:18,689
I'd love to tell you but
I don't think I should.

885
01:10:21,192 --> 01:10:22,318
Why ever not?

886
01:10:27,698 --> 01:10:29,825
I wouldn't want to risk my authority.

887
01:10:52,973 --> 01:10:56,352
Take it from me, what you're
looking at is the future.

888
01:10:58,395 --> 01:11:02,191
You think they know we're on our
way, bringing them the plague?

889
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:30,302
Fraulein Spielrein.

890
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,016
Whose idea was it for you to
send me your dissertation?

891
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:39,061
The Herr Direktor.

892
01:11:39,103 --> 01:11:41,230
Yes, of course.

893
01:11:44,483 --> 01:11:49,238
He kept insisting this was the kind of material
you were looking for for your Yearbook.

894
01:11:50,865 --> 01:11:54,117
It certainly is a very fascinating
case you've chosen to investigate.

895
01:11:54,118 --> 01:11:57,176
But if we're to consider it
for the Yearbook, there are

896
01:11:57,177 --> 01:12:00,124
one or two mistakes which
will have to be dealt with.

897
01:12:00,165 --> 01:12:01,709
Of course.

898
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,254
Might you have a little
time to discuss all this?

899
01:12:07,464 --> 01:12:08,382
Yes.

900
01:12:13,512 --> 01:12:16,985
When I left the hospital and moved
out here I was afraid it would take

901
01:12:16,986 --> 01:12:20,311
years to build up a roster of
patients but I'm already under siege.

902
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,734
Anyway, I don't see why a
little more work won't

903
01:12:25,735 --> 01:12:28,319
make your dissertation
eminently publishable.

904
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:31,947
Do you think we'd be able to
work on it together without...?

905
01:12:38,495 --> 01:12:42,208
It's always going to be something
of a risk, us seeing one another.

906
01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:44,835
Yes.

907
01:12:45,711 --> 01:12:48,923
But I believe we have the character to be
able to deal with the situation, don't you?

908
01:12:50,257 --> 01:12:51,342
I hope so.

909
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:57,932
I somehow imagined you'd have
found another admirer by now.

910
01:12:59,558 --> 01:13:00,309
No.

911
01:13:02,686 --> 01:13:04,438
You were the jewel of great price.

912
01:13:12,196 --> 01:13:14,198
Shall we say this time next Tuesday?

913
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,618
And I'll start gently
ripping you to shreds.

914
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:32,258
Explain this analogy you make between the
sex instinct and the death instinct.

915
01:13:33,968 --> 01:13:40,140
Professor Freud claims that the sexual drive
arises from a simple urge towards pleasure.

916
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:44,311
If he's right, the question is why is this
urge so often successfully repressed?

917
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:47,878
You used to have a theory
involving the impulse towards

918
01:13:47,879 --> 01:13:51,026
destruction and self-destruction,
losing oneself.

919
01:13:51,068 --> 01:13:56,589
Well, suppose we think of sexuality as fusion...
losing oneself, as you say, but

920
01:13:56,590 --> 01:14:02,246
losing oneself in the other...
in other words, destroying one's own individuality.

921
01:14:02,288 --> 01:14:06,041
Wouldn't the ego, in self-defense,
automatically resist that impulse?

922
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:08,919
You mean for selfish not
for social reasons?

923
01:14:08,961 --> 01:14:09,628
Yes.

924
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:14,967
I'm saying that perhaps true sexuality
demands the destruction of the ego.

925
01:14:17,511 --> 01:14:20,556
In other words, the opposite
of what Freud proposes.

926
01:15:01,889 --> 01:15:04,600
When I graduate, I've
decided to leave Zurich.

927
01:15:09,897 --> 01:15:10,898
I have to.

928
01:15:14,485 --> 01:15:15,361
Why?

929
01:15:15,402 --> 01:15:17,363
You know why.

930
01:15:24,245 --> 01:15:25,204
It's true.

931
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:32,294
I'm nothing but a philistine Swiss
bourgeois complacent coward.

932
01:15:32,336 --> 01:15:38,384
I want to leave everything, break
away and disappear with you.

933
01:15:42,513 --> 01:15:44,557
Then comes the voice of the philistine.

934
01:15:49,228 --> 01:15:50,187
Where will you go?

935
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:52,731
Vienna, maybe.

936
01:15:53,774 --> 01:15:54,900
Please don't go there.

937
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,280
I must go wherever I need to feel free.

938
01:16:11,584 --> 01:16:12,418
<sobbing> Don't...

939
01:16:27,224 --> 01:16:28,267
You know your paper...

940
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:31,567
led to one of the most
stimulating discussions

941
01:16:31,568 --> 01:16:33,981
we've ever had at the
Psychoanalytic Society.

942
01:16:35,566 --> 01:16:39,820
Do you really think the sexual drive
is a demonic and destructive force?

943
01:16:39,862 --> 01:16:44,502
Yes, at the same time as being a
creative force, in the sense that it can

944
01:16:44,503 --> 01:16:48,829
produce, out of the destruction of
two individualities, a new being.

945
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:52,025
But the individual must always
overcome resistance because

946
01:16:52,026 --> 01:16:54,752
of the self-annihilating
nature of the sexual act.

947
01:16:57,338 --> 01:16:58,297
Hm.

948
01:16:58,339 --> 01:17:03,550
I've fought against the idea for
some time, but I suppose there

949
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:08,599
must be some kind of indissoluble
link between sex and death.

950
01:17:10,351 --> 01:17:14,493
I don't feel the relationship between the
two is quite the way you have portrayed it,

951
01:17:14,494 --> 01:17:18,442
but I'm most grateful to you for animating
the subject in such a stimulating way.

952
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:22,852
The only slight shock was
your introduction, at the

953
01:17:22,853 --> 01:17:25,783
very end of your paper,
of the name of Christ.

954
01:17:27,993 --> 01:17:32,998
Are you completely opposed to any kind
of religious dimension in our field?

955
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,404
In general, I don't care if a
man believes in Rama, Marx or

956
01:17:36,405 --> 01:17:39,880
Aphrodite, as long as he keeps
it out of the consulting room.

957
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:43,259
Is that what's at the bottom
of your dispute with Dr.

958
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:43,843
Jung?

959
01:17:43,844 --> 01:17:47,054
I have no dispute with Dr.

960
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:47,555
Jung.

961
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:50,683
I was simply mistaken about him.

962
01:17:51,892 --> 01:17:55,228
I thought he was going to be able to
carry our work forward after I was gone.

963
01:17:55,229 --> 01:18:00,109
I didn't bargain for all that second-rate
mysticism and self-aggrandizing shamanism.

964
01:18:01,485 --> 01:18:05,155
Nor did I realize he could be
so brutal and sanctimonious.

965
01:18:05,197 --> 01:18:09,050
He's trying to find some way
forward so that we don't just have

966
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:12,663
to tell our patients, "This is
why you are the way you are."

967
01:18:12,705 --> 01:18:17,084
He wants to be able to say, "We can show
you what it is you might want to become."

968
01:18:17,126 --> 01:18:19,128
Playing God, in other words.

969
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:21,589
We have no right to do that.

970
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:25,009
The world is as it is.

971
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:30,890
Understanding and accepting that
is the way to psychic health.

972
01:18:30,931 --> 01:18:37,104
What good can we do if our aim is simply
to replace one delusion with another?

973
01:18:41,066 --> 01:18:42,484
Well, I agree with you.

974
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:45,029
Hm.

975
01:18:46,071 --> 01:18:49,240
I've noticed that in the crucial
areas of dispute between Dr.

976
01:18:49,241 --> 01:18:50,951
Jung and myself, you tend to favour me.

977
01:18:52,036 --> 01:18:54,038
I thought you had no dispute with him.

978
01:18:55,247 --> 01:18:56,123
Hm.

979
01:18:59,627 --> 01:19:00,961
You still love him.

980
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:03,464
That's not why I'm pleading his cause.

981
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:08,850
I just feel that if you two don't
find some way to co-exist, it will

982
01:19:08,851 --> 01:19:13,807
hold back the progress of
psychoanalysis, perhaps indefinitely.

983
01:19:15,226 --> 01:19:17,186
Is there no way to avert a rupture?

984
01:19:17,228 --> 01:19:21,982
Correct scientific relations
will be maintained, of course.

985
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:24,598
I'll be seeing him at the
editorial meeting in

986
01:19:24,599 --> 01:19:27,446
Munich in September and I
shall be perfectly civil.

987
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:33,202
To tell you the truth, what finished him
for me was all that business about you.

988
01:19:33,244 --> 01:19:35,955
The lies, the ruthless behaviour.

989
01:19:35,996 --> 01:19:37,790
I was very shocked.

990
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:41,502
I think he loved me.

991
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:48,133
I'm afraid your idea of a mystical union with
a blond Siegfried was inevitably doomed.

992
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:55,516
Put not your trust in Aryans.

993
01:19:57,268 --> 01:20:03,524
We're Jews, my dear Miss Spielrein,
and Jews we will always be.

994
01:20:07,153 --> 01:20:11,711
Now, the real reason I invited
you here this evening was to ask

995
01:20:11,712 --> 01:20:15,912
if you'd be prepared to take
on one or two of my patients?

996
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:23,672
I was interested in what you
said about monotheism...

997
01:20:23,673 --> 01:20:27,090
that it arose historically out of
some kind of patricidal impulse.

998
01:20:27,131 --> 01:20:28,132
Yes.

999
01:20:28,174 --> 01:20:32,173
Akhnaton, who, as far as we
know, was the first to put

1000
01:20:32,174 --> 01:20:36,099
forth the bizarre notion
that there was only one God.

1001
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:42,729
Also had his father's name erased and
chiseled out of all public monuments.

1002
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:43,981
That's not strictly true.

1003
01:20:44,857 --> 01:20:45,817
Not true?

1004
01:20:45,858 --> 01:20:47,026
No.

1005
01:20:48,403 --> 01:20:50,571
You mean it was most probably a myth?

1006
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:51,948
No.

1007
01:20:51,989 --> 01:20:56,268
I mean there were two perfectly straightforward
reasons for Akhnaton, or Amenhopis

1008
01:20:56,269 --> 01:21:00,289
IV as I prefer to call him, to excise
his father's name from the car touches.

1009
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:04,512
First, this was something traditionally
done by all new kings who

1010
01:21:04,513 --> 01:21:08,756
didn't wish their father's name to
continue to be public currency.

1011
01:21:08,798 --> 01:21:14,387
In much the same way as your article in
the Yearbook fails to mention my name?

1012
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:18,391
Your name is so well-known it hardly
seemed necessary to mention it.

1013
01:21:18,433 --> 01:21:19,934
Do go on.

1014
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:23,024
Secondly, Amenhopis only
struck out the first half

1015
01:21:23,025 --> 01:21:26,072
of his father's name,
Amenhotep, because, like the

1016
01:21:26,073 --> 01:21:29,120
first half of his own name,
it was shared by Amon,

1017
01:21:29,121 --> 01:21:31,988
one of the gods he was
determined to eliminate.

1018
01:21:32,905 --> 01:21:33,781
Hm.

1019
01:21:33,823 --> 01:21:36,075
As simple as that?

1020
01:21:36,117 --> 01:21:39,454
The explanation doesn't
seem to me unduly simple.

1021
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:44,219
And do you think your man,
whatever you call him,

1022
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:48,755
felt no hostility whatsoever
toward his father?

1023
01:21:48,796 --> 01:21:51,048
I have no means of proof, of course.

1024
01:21:51,049 --> 01:21:55,106
For all I know, Amenhopis may have
thought that his father's name was quite

1025
01:21:55,107 --> 01:21:59,057
familiar enough and that now it might
be time to make a name for himself.

1026
01:22:19,327 --> 01:22:23,164
How sweet it must be to die.

1027
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:30,784
If I may say so, dear
Professor, you make the

1028
01:22:30,785 --> 01:22:33,966
mistake of treating your
friends like patients.

1029
01:22:34,008 --> 01:22:38,844
This enables you to reduce them to the level
of children, so that their only choice

1030
01:22:38,845 --> 01:22:43,393
is to become obsequious nonentities or
bullying enforcers of the party line...

1031
01:22:43,935 --> 01:22:49,763
while you sit on the mountaintop, the infallible
father-figure and nobody dares to pluck you by

1032
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:55,530
the beard and say, Think about your behaviour and
then decide which one of us is the neurotic.

1033
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:57,240
I speak as a friend.

1034
01:22:57,281 --> 01:22:58,783
Hm.

1035
01:23:19,512 --> 01:23:21,597
Your letter cannot be answered.

1036
01:23:21,639 --> 01:23:27,519
Your claim that I treat my friends like
patients is self-evidently untrue.

1037
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,850
As to which of us is the neurotic,
I thought we analysts were

1038
01:23:31,851 --> 01:23:36,320
agreed a little neurosis was
nothing whatever to be ashamed of.

1039
01:23:36,362 --> 01:23:41,884
But a man like you, who behaves quite
abnormally and then stands there shouting at

1040
01:23:41,885 --> 01:23:47,206
the top of his voice how normal he is
does give considerable cause for concern.

1041
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:53,296
For a long time now our relationship
has been hanging by a thread.

1042
01:23:53,338 --> 01:23:59,093
And a thread, moreover, mostly
consisting of past disappointments.

1043
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:02,305
We have nothing to lose by cutting it.

1044
01:24:13,816 --> 01:24:16,486
You will be the best judge of
what this moment means to you.

1045
01:24:18,071 --> 01:24:19,364
The rest is silence.

1046
01:24:47,475 --> 01:24:50,019
So good to have met you
at last, Dr. Spielrein.

1047
01:24:51,229 --> 01:24:55,191
We did meet once before when I
was your husband's patient.

1048
01:24:57,777 --> 01:24:58,778
I think you're right.

1049
01:25:03,825 --> 01:25:05,576
Your children are glorious.

1050
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:09,163
Thank you.

1051
01:25:09,164 --> 01:25:11,499
You must let us know when yours arrives.

1052
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:13,459
I expect you want a boy.

1053
01:25:13,501 --> 01:25:14,168
No.

1054
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:18,256
No, my husband and I both
think we would prefer a girl.

1055
01:25:18,297 --> 01:25:19,507
Really?

1056
01:25:26,889 --> 01:25:28,016
I wish you could help him.

1057
01:25:28,975 --> 01:25:30,101
Why?

1058
01:25:30,143 --> 01:25:30,727
What's the matter?

1059
01:25:30,728 --> 01:25:32,061
He's not himself.

1060
01:25:33,813 --> 01:25:36,566
He's very confused and
bogged down with his book.

1061
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:38,901
He's not sleeping.

1062
01:25:38,943 --> 01:25:41,696
He's not taking on any new patients.

1063
01:25:41,738 --> 01:25:46,325
He still hasn't recovered from the violence
of his break with Professor Freud.

1064
01:25:47,827 --> 01:25:51,497
What you're describing is
very unlike my memory of him.

1065
01:25:51,539 --> 01:25:56,210
If you were staying in town, I'd try to
persuade him to let you analyze him.

1066
01:26:00,256 --> 01:26:04,927
I know he always set great
store by your opinion.

1067
01:26:06,888 --> 01:26:08,389
You are taking patients now?

1068
01:26:08,431 --> 01:26:14,103
I've pretty much decided to
specialize in child psychology.

1069
01:26:14,145 --> 01:26:17,898
I'm not sure if it's a
field he approves of.

1070
01:26:17,899 --> 01:26:20,109
I haven't discussed it with him but...

1071
01:26:23,446 --> 01:26:25,031
You better go and talk to him.

1072
01:26:33,331 --> 01:26:35,333
No one can help him more than you.

1073
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:37,418
I hope you're right.

1074
01:27:00,233 --> 01:27:01,943
Your children are beautiful.

1075
01:27:08,449 --> 01:27:09,575
So you're married.

1076
01:27:11,786 --> 01:27:12,620
Yes.

1077
01:27:15,248 --> 01:27:16,082
He's a doctor?

1078
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:19,252
Yes.

1079
01:27:19,293 --> 01:27:20,670
His name is Pavel Scheftel.

1080
01:27:22,922 --> 01:27:23,756
Russian.

1081
01:27:26,634 --> 01:27:28,136
Yes, a Russian Jew.

1082
01:27:32,306 --> 01:27:33,266
What's he like?

1083
01:27:35,977 --> 01:27:36,894
Kind.

1084
01:27:41,357 --> 01:27:44,235
Good, good.

1085
01:27:47,071 --> 01:27:48,448
Are you all right?

1086
01:27:48,489 --> 01:27:49,741
Yes.

1087
01:27:52,118 --> 01:27:55,538
I haven't been sleeping very well and
I keep having this apocalyptic dream.

1088
01:27:57,248 --> 01:27:59,917
A terrible flood from the
North Sea to the Alps.

1089
01:28:01,169 --> 01:28:02,503
Houses washed away.

1090
01:28:03,421 --> 01:28:05,214
Thousands of floating corpses.

1091
01:28:07,342 --> 01:28:11,220
Eventually it comes crashing into
the lake in a great tidal wave.

1092
01:28:12,889 --> 01:28:22,065
And by this time, the water, roaring down like
some vast avalanche, has turned to blood.

1093
01:28:24,359 --> 01:28:25,526
The blood of Europe.

1094
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,698
What do you think it means?

1095
01:28:33,993 --> 01:28:35,370
I've no idea.

1096
01:28:37,038 --> 01:28:38,414
Unless it's about to happen.

1097
01:28:42,794 --> 01:28:43,795
What are your plans?

1098
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:47,924
We've been thinking of
going back to Russia.

1099
01:28:49,425 --> 01:28:50,760
As long as you leave Vienna.

1100
01:28:53,846 --> 01:28:55,390
I spoke to him last week.

1101
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:56,766
I can't believe there's nothing to be done.

1102
01:28:56,808 --> 01:28:57,558
There's nothing to be done.

1103
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,495
The day he refused to discuss a
dream with me on the grounds

1104
01:29:00,496 --> 01:29:03,106
that it might risk his authority,
I should have known.

1105
01:29:05,149 --> 01:29:07,276
After that, for me, he had no authority.

1106
01:29:09,237 --> 01:29:12,115
It was a blow when I discovered
you'd chosen his side.

1107
01:29:12,156 --> 01:29:14,117
It's not a question of sides.

1108
01:29:14,951 --> 01:29:18,871
I have to work in the direction my instinct
tells my intelligence is the right one.

1109
01:29:18,913 --> 01:29:21,374
Don't forget, you cured me with his method.

1110
01:29:23,418 --> 01:29:26,713
What he'll never accept is that what
we understand has got us nowhere.

1111
01:29:27,755 --> 01:29:29,674
We have to go into uncharted territory.

1112
01:29:29,716 --> 01:29:33,261
We have to go back to the sources
of everything we believe.

1113
01:29:33,302 --> 01:29:35,907
I don't want to just
open a door and show the

1114
01:29:35,908 --> 01:29:38,682
patient his illness squatting
there like a toad.

1115
01:29:38,683 --> 01:29:41,352
I want to try and find a way to
help the patient reinvent himself.

1116
01:29:41,394 --> 01:29:43,627
To send him off on a journey
at the end of which is

1117
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,732
waiting the person he was
always intended to be.

1118
01:29:45,773 --> 01:29:49,777
It's no good making yourself
ill in the process.

1119
01:29:52,196 --> 01:29:54,365
Only the wounded physician
can hope to heal.

1120
01:30:05,126 --> 01:30:06,711
I'm told you have a new mistress.

1121
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:09,381
Is that right?

1122
01:30:10,841 --> 01:30:12,050
What's her name?

1123
01:30:13,134 --> 01:30:13,969
Toni.

1124
01:30:15,387 --> 01:30:16,555
Is she like me?

1125
01:30:16,596 --> 01:30:17,681
No.

1126
01:30:17,722 --> 01:30:19,057
She's an ex-patient?

1127
01:30:20,392 --> 01:30:21,017
Yes.

1128
01:30:21,059 --> 01:30:21,685
Jewish?

1129
01:30:23,728 --> 01:30:24,813
Half Jewish.

1130
01:30:25,897 --> 01:30:27,274
Training to be an analyst?

1131
01:30:27,315 --> 01:30:28,108
Yes.

1132
01:30:29,442 --> 01:30:30,569
But she's not like me?

1133
01:30:33,029 --> 01:30:34,573
Of course she makes me think of you.

1134
01:30:37,868 --> 01:30:39,202
How do you make it work?

1135
01:30:39,244 --> 01:30:40,871
I don't know.

1136
01:30:43,415 --> 01:30:46,126
Emma, as you've seen, is the
foundation of my house.

1137
01:30:48,211 --> 01:30:50,005
Toni is the perfume in the air.

1138
01:30:57,262 --> 01:30:59,890
My love for you was the most
important thing in my life.

1139
01:30:59,931 --> 01:31:05,770
For better or worse, made
me understand who I am.

1140
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:17,741
<music> This should be mine.

1141
01:31:19,534 --> 01:31:20,368
Yes.

1142
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:29,794
Sometimes you have to do something
unforgivable just to be able to go on living.
